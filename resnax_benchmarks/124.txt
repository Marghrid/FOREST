// natural language
Letâ€™s take a password as a combination of alphanumeric characters along with special characters, and check whether the password is valid or not with the help of few conditions. Conditions for a valid password are: Should have at least one number. Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character. Should have at least one special symbol. Should be between 6 to 20 characters long.

// example
"Geek12#",+
"asd123",-

// gt
and(contain(<num>),and(and(contain(<cap>),contain(<low>)),and(contain(<spec>),repeatrange(<any>,6,20))))
