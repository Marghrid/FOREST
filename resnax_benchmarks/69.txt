// natural language
I would like to validate a string format that should only contain only numbers with also following conditions both satisfied:  If it is a integer number, the maximum number of digits is 5. If it is a number with decimal (or decimal fraction), the maximum digits after decimal mark is two. NOTE: value use comma or dot (""."") as decimal point. Please bear in mind that both of the two conditions have to be satisfied"

// example
"12345",+
"10,23",+
"123456",-
"10,234",-
"123456,12",-
"3,345",-

// gt
concat(repeatrange(<num>,1,5),optional(concat(or(<.>,<,>),repeatrange(<num>,1,2))))
