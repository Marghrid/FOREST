// natural language
I am trying to create a regular expression in javascript with the following rules: At least 2 characters. Should have at least 1 letter as a prefix and end with a ""."" or have "" "" or ""-"" and then have more letters.

// example
"aa",+
"aaaaa",+
"a.",+
"a-a",+
"a a",+
"a",-
"aa.aa.",-
"aa-",-

// gt
and(repeatatleast(<any>,2),concat(repeatatleast(<let>,1),or(endwith(<.>),concat(optional(or(< >,<->)),repeatatleast(<let>,1)))))
